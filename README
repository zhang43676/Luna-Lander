Lunar Lander Game:
Run lander from the command line e.g. as in the following three examples.

    ./lander -g 0 -t -5 -f landscape.txt
    ./lander -g 9.8 -t -20 -f landscape.txt
    ./lander -g 1.6 -t -5 -f landscape.txt

    -g represents gravity, causing acceleration towards the moon
    -t represents the thrust, the acceleration created by the ships thrusters when they are on.
    -f has one argument, the name of a text file containing points that represent the landscape.
    lander must respond to key clicks. Do this by using curses.
    You must be able to rotate your ship.
    Your ship must fall according to gravity. You can do this using signals.
    Handle the three command line arguments specified above.
    You must read in a text file specified using the -f option that represents a landscape. A sample file is landscape.txt.
    Your ship must respond to thrust.
    lander must appropriately detect a crash or a landing by testing for  line segment intersection.
